- 👋 Hi, I’m @amrmarey15
- 👀 I’m interested in Power electonics, control systems, machine learning, communications systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning theoretical machine learning, digitial communications for modulation classification, shell-scripting on Linux 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that Machine learning can be applied to. Right now, I am very interested in the field and I would love to hear your idea to see how we can work as a team to apply ML together. Furthermore, aside from ML, I am currently developing a circuit solver program on MATLAB to help first/second year electrical engineering students with their circuits class
